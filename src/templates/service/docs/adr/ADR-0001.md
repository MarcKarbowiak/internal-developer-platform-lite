# ADR-0001: Service Scaffold Baseline for __SERVICE_NAME__

- Status: Accepted
- Date: __GENERATED_DATE_ISO__
- Service: __SERVICE_NAME__

## Context

This service is generated from the IDP Lite golden path. The platform baseline aims to reduce setup variance and enforce operational readiness from day one.

## Decision

We adopt the generated baseline with:

- Fastify HTTP server
- Strict TypeScript compilation
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- OpenTelemetry bootstrap for distributed tracing
- Health/readiness endpoints
- CI workflow with lint, test, coverage gate, build, and Docker validation

## Consequences

### Positive

- Faster and consistent service bootstrap
- Shared operational and delivery standards
- Easier supportability across teams

### Tradeoffs

- Some flexibility is intentionally constrained by platform defaults
- Teams may need ADR follow-ups for service-specific deviations

## Follow-up

Record additional ADRs for changes to runtime choices, data stores, security boundaries, or SLO targets.
